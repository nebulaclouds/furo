## Elevator pitch

<!-- start elevator-pitch -->

- **Intentionally minimal** --- the most important thing is the content, not the scaffolding around it.
- **Responsive** --- adapting perfectly to the available screen space, to work on all sorts of devices.
- **Customisable** --- change the color palette, font families, logo and more!
- **Easy to navigate** --- with carefully-designed sidebar navigation and inter-page links.
- **Good looking content** --- through clear typography and well-stylised elements.
- **Good looking search** --- helps readers find what they want quickly.
- **Biased for smaller docsets** --- intended for smaller documentation sets, where presenting the entire hierarchy in the sidebar is not overwhelming.

## Quickstart

<!-- start quickstart -->

Furo is distributed on [PyPI]. To use the theme in your Sphinx project:

1. Install Furo in documentation's build environment.

   ```text
   pip install furo
   ```

2. Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.

   ```py
   html_theme = "furo"
   ```

3. Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! 🎉

## Contributing

Furo is a volunteer maintained open source project, and we welcome contributions of all forms. Please take a look at our [Contributing Guide](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/contributing/) for more information.

## Acknowledgements

Furo is inspired by (and borrows elements from) some excellent technical documentation themes:

## What's with the name?

I plucked this from the scientific name for [Domesticated Ferrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret): Mustela putorius **furo**.

A ferret is actually a really good spirit animal for this project: cute, small, steals little things from various places, and hisses at you when you try to make it do things it doesn't like.

> I plan on commissioning a logo for this project (or making one myself) consisting of a cute ferret. Please reach out if you're interested!

## Nebula Customizations

This fork of `furo` adds some nebula-specific customizations. For example, the
css styles are slightly different from the upstream repo, the `navbar.html`
file has custom elements, and the `main.js` file has custom logic to pull
together all the different Nebula documentation sites.

### Setup

We recommend using `conda` to isolate your enviroment from your system's `node`
installation. [Install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
depending on your system, then create a virtual environment:

```
conda create -n nebula-furo python=3.9
conda activate nebula-furo
conda install -c conda-forge nox nodejs==15.14.0
```

You may have to create a new shell session to make sure the correct node
executable is being used. You should expect it to point to the path of your
conda environment, for example:

```
$ which node
/path/to/miniconda3/envs/nebula-furo/bin/node
```

Then install npm dependencies with `npm install`.

### Building the Docs Locally

To build the docs locally, do:

```
$ nox -s docs-live
```

### Updating the `furo` package

Since we don't have a proper deployment system for our fork of furo, we always
install furo in the nebula docs using:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/nebulaclouds/furo@main
```

Therefore, we need to check in all the compiled code that's typically not
checked into git. So if you make changes to any of the `css` or `js` files in
the `src` directory, you need to compile the project and check it in.

The `nox -s docs-live` command above should generate all the files needed, so after
a successful build you can add the changes and commit it as usual.
